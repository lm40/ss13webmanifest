# SS13 Web Manifest (Java)
This project is an open source program which hooks over network with BYOND to allow users to view the manifest from a website.
## Ownership
This is a fork of https://github.com/cadyn/ss13webmanifest to incorporate some small Rogue Star specific changes. The credit for this really belongs to the authors of the original repository, I have just created this repository to comply with source code availability for modifications I make.
## Requirements
Java JDK 11 or greater
## Arguments
All arguments are formatted as such: --arg=value, so you would run: java -jar manifest-0.1.1.jar --arg1=value1 --arg2=value2... etc
server.port (default: 4583): The port on which the web manifest is hosted
socket.host: The hostname of the SS13 server to get the manifest from
socket.port: The port on which to get the manifest from the SS13 server
ttl (default: 60000): How long the web manifest should use the cache before getting a new manifest from the SS13 server in milliseconds.
## Usage
This will be best used in combination with a program such as apache or nginx to reverse proxy to the app, however if you would like to simply use this on it's own, pointing a domain at the correct IP address and setting the server.port to 80 will allow users to view the website under HTTP

Windows:
Run build.bat to build with gradle.
The built jar will go to ./build/lib/manifest-VERSION.jar

To run as service:
Update ./misc/windows/WinSW.xml, replace PATHTO with the path to this repository, replace SS13HOSTNAME with the IP or domain/hostname of your SS13 server, and SS13PORT with the port for your SS13server, as well as make any modifications you need to, such as adding more arguments.
Run install.bat

Linux:
Run build.sh to build with gradle
The built jar will go to ./build/lib/manifest-VERSION.jar

To run as service(Systemd enabled systems only):
Update ./misc/linux/webmanifest.service, replace PATHTO with the path to this repository, replace SS13HOSTNAME with the IP or domain/hostname of your SS13 server, and SS13PORT with the port for your SS13server, as well as make any modifications you need to, such as adding more arguments.
For user install: run user_install.sh as the user you want to install the service as.
For root/system install: run sudo root_install.sh

## Making this work with your ss13 code
Inside of misc/dmsrc is currently only polaris_world.dm, which contains world/Topic() code that should be functional with polaris code. You can modify this code to suit your own codebase or you can request that a new version be made. I may create one for TG codebases in the near future.
